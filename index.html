                    The case of any Monaco is one of the key elements that makes it such an iconic
                    and instantly recognisable watch. The 39mm steel case is finished with brushed
                    bezel and case sides while the lugs and bevels feature polished surfaces. The
                    faceted crystal that sits over the dial protrudes slightly above the case,
                    reminiscent of a thick piece of vintage crystal, just like it would have been
                    when first launched 52 years ago.

                  <p class="carousel__text-paragraph">
                    This is where the real show is, with the dial offering a totally new and also
                    “trending” colour green. But as you’d expect from TAG Heuer, this isn’t a dull
                    or flat green tone. Far from it, the green is an engaging sunburst colour that
                    has a smoked effect which gradually shifts from apple green in the centre of the
                    dial to black around its circumference. The white hands cut a sharp contrast
                    against the graduated backdrop, matching the white printed TAG Heuer logo at 12
                    o’clock. In further contrast to the green of the centre of the dial, the two
                    square subdials are matte black, while running seconds at 6 o’clock hosts the
                    black date aperture.

                    HANDS-ON: TAG Heuer Monaco Green Limited Edition is a fumé fantasy
                  </h1>
                  <p class="carousel__text-paragraph">
                    The TAG Heuer Monaco is a classic in every sense of the word. I mean, Steve
                    McQueen famously wore it on the silver screen and if you’re looking for an
                    endorsement from the King of Cool, it doesn’t get much better than that. The
                    Monaco has been a collection that has regularly been refreshed in recent years
                    with its 50th anniversary back in 2019 inspiring more than half a dozen limited
                    edition references. In 2021, the new expressions of the Monaco continue and in a
                    year like this, what is the only colour you’d really expect to see? Say hello to
                    the all-new TAG Heuer Monaco Green Limited Edition.

                    Powering the TAG Heuer Monaco Green Limited Edition is the go-to-choice for the
                    La Chaux-de-Fonds based watchmaker – the Calibre Heuer 02 Automatic. It’s the
                    same caliber as what you will find across much of the Carrera and Autavia
                    collections, beating at 28,800vph and delivering a full 80 hours of power
                    reserve.

                    The watch arrives on a black alligator leather strap that is secured with a
                    solidly made folding steel clasp. The clasp is almost infinitely adjustable,
                    making it perfect for pretty much any wrist size.

                  <p class="carousel__text-paragraph">
                    TAG Heuer had already joined the Green Party that the entire Swiss watchmaking
                    industry is hosting this year with their Aquaracer Professional 300 in titanium,
                    but I’m glad to see a slightly more refined expression of the popular hue. The
                    Monaco is a tried and true winner and while a green dial is a cosmetic update to
                    the angular legend, it is a stunning dial to see in the metal. The transition
                    from such a bright and vibrant green at the centre of the dial to black around
                    the outside is dramatic and is a feature that will surely see this new limited
                    edition sell out quick-smart.
